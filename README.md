# RISK ANALYSIS of FX and Interest Rates with Monte-Carlo Simulation and AAD

## Abstract
A Monte-Carlo simulation serves as an established algorithmic framework, offering robust capabilities in the realms of financial and quantitative analysisâ€”particularly in the pricing of complex derivatives and in navigating intricate market dynamics. This project delves into the conjunction of Monte-Carlo simulation and an advanced computational method known as Algorithmic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD), intending to enhance the per- formance of the Monte-Carlo simulations. Initially, we examine the foun- dational principles of both Monte-Carlo simulation and AAD, explaining these concepts through practical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a risk analysis focusing on foreign exchange and interest rates, deploying four distinct simulation methodologies. We check that parallel Monte-Carlo simulation emerges as the most efficient technique. Moreover, we check that Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating AAD require significantly greater computational time and memory resources compared to their classical counterparts.


## Getting Started
### Step.1: Cleaning and Building
make clean
make

### Step.2: Serial Monte-Carlo Simulation
To run a serial Monte-Carlo simulation, use the following command:
./main

### Step.3: Serial Monte-Carlo Simulation with AAD
To perform a serial Monte-Carlo simulation that incorporates AAD, use the following command:
./main_mcaad

### Step.4: Parallel Monte-Carlo Simulation
For a parallel version of the Monte-Carlo simulation, execute the following command:
./main_pthread

### Step.5: Parallel Monte-Carlo Simulation with AAD
Before running this simulation, make sure to check the 'reset_adjoint()' function in the 'Node_v1.h' header file (lines 52-79). Use the following command to run the simulation:
./main_multiaad

## Note
Ensure to review and possibly adjust the 'reset_adjoint()' function in the 'Node_v1.h' header file (lines 52-79) before initiating the parallel Monte-Carlo simulation with AAD.
